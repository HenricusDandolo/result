2. However, after 12.Nov daily increasing subscription of this channel is lower than 0. We can state that the articles published after 12.Nov much less attractive than the earlier articles.
To quantify the attraction of the articles, we use reading rate. reading rate = view number / subscription number.
The average reading rate of articles after 12.Nov is 0.056
The average reading rate of articles before 12.Nov is 0.136
The articles before 12.Nov is much more attractive than articles after 12.Nov

#explanation and result
The tag of articles before 12.Nov and after 12.Nov are quite similar, However the articles are less attractive. That's because the old users who focus on covid pandemic all subscribe this officail account and get to saturation, So to make articles more attractive to new users. This official account should push articles which topic is concerned by people in JinShan community
